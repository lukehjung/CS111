Description of Files:
lab4c_tcp.c: C file that runs on beagle bone environment and connects to a TCP server 
with a temp log and accepts commands.  Similar to 4b assignment, with new parameters.
Will generate same report, but through network connection rather than all internally.

lab4c_tls.c: Same as TCP file, but uses TLS authentication to connect.

Makefile: standard make file that uses options of default, clean, and dist.
