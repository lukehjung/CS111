What is operating system??
System OED (1928): 
I. Organized or connected group of objects
II. Set of principles, etc. a scheme, a method.
from Greek, set up with

SK. A set of interconnected components that has a specfiied behavior observed at the interface with it's environment.

American Heritage Dictionary:
Software designed to control the hardware of a specific data processing system in order to allow users and application programs to make use of it

Operating system is all about control, what's in charge for your computer

Wikipedia
System software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs

Think of operating systems as a optimization problem, minimum cost solution to managing resources

OS GOALS
-protection
-flexibility
-simplicity
-preformance
-robustness

ls -l big
time grep x big

grep looks at the 0's of metadata of file and skips over them to be really fast


Problems with Operating Systems
I. Tradeoffs (The waterbed effect)
	1. Time space tradefff in sorting
	2. Authentification
		-passwords
			-cheap
		-hardware tokens
			-harder to forge
II. Incommenseurate Scaling
	-Not everything scales at the same rate.
	-Diseconomies of scale (star network) (can cause breakage)
	-Economies of scale (pin factor) (can cause waste)
III. Emergent properties 
	-Grow so large that new things happen at a higher level of abstraction.
	-Unanticipated larger properties when scaling.

		-UCLA dorm netowrks, 1980s
IV. Propagation of Effects
	-naturally in chaotic systems
	-character encoding interferes with file names so can't create directories
V. 	Complexitiy
	-Moore's Law: Complexity goes up as time goes on
	-Kyrder's Law
	-Account of transistors is increasing, not speed.
	-Complexity is growing, but speed to attack those problems are a big issue.
